## Theorem: addition principle

For two disjoint sets, the cardinality of their union is:

\begin{equation*}
|S_{1} \cup S_{2}| = |S_{1}| + |S_{2}|
\end{equation*}

For two non-disjoint sets, the cardinality of their union is given by the **addition principle**:

\begin{equation*}
|S_{1} \cup S_{2}| = |S_{1}| + |S_{2}| - |S_{1} \cap S_{2}|
\end{equation*}
