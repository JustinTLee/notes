# Relations

## Definitions

* **antisymmetric** - relation where $a \, R \, b$ and $b R a$ exist only when $a = b$
* **asymmetric** - relation where either $a \, R \, b$ and $b \, R \, a$ do not exist
* **composition** - combining two or more paths to get from the beginning of the first path to the end of the last path
* **connected** - any vertex is reachable from another vertex
* **cycles** - paths that start and end at same vertex
* **directed graph** (**digraph**) - representing a relation matrix as a graph
* **domain** - ($\text{dom}\{R\}$) set of elements in $A$ which are related to an element in $B$
* **equivalence class** - subset of all elements in which $x \, R \, a$ holds true for a given $a$
* **equivalence** - relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive
* **graph** - digraph that shows symmetric relations
* **in-degree** - is amount of directed edges leading to vertex $a$
* **inverse path** - the reverse order of a path to get from the last vertex back to the first vertex
* **irreflexive** - relation where $a \, \not{\text{R}} \, a$ for all $a \in A$
* **out-degree** - amount of directed edges coming out of vertex $a$
* **range** - ($\text{range}\{R\}$) set of elements in $B$ which form an ordered pair with an element in $A$.
* **reachability** - $x$ is either the same as $y$, or there is some path that can lead from $x$ to $y$
* **reflexive** - relation where $a \, R \, a$ for all $a \in A$
* **relation** - subset of $A \times B$
* **restriction of $R$ to $B$** - $R \cup B \times B$ when $B \subseteq A$
* **symmetric** - relation where $a \, R \, b$ and $b \, R \, a$ exist
* **transitive** - relation when if when $a \, R \, b$ and $b \, R \, c$ then $a \, R \, c$
* **undirected edge** - edge that depicts asymmetric relation between two vertices: $(a, b)$
