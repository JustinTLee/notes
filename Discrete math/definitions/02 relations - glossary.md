# Relations

## Definitions

* **relation** - subset of $A \times B$
* **domain** - ($\text{dom}\{R\}$) set of elements in $A$ which are related to an element in $B$
* **range** - ($\text{range}\{R\}$) set of elements in $B$ which form an ordered pair with an element in $A$.
* **directed graph** (**digraph**) - representing a relation matrix as a graph
* **in-degree** - is amount of directed edges leading to vertex $a$
* **out-degree** - amount of directed edges coming out of vertex $a$
* **restriction of $R$ to $B$** - $R \cup B \times B$ when $B \subseteq A$
* **cycles** - paths that start and end at same vertex
* **reachability** - $x$ is either the same as $y$, or there is some path that can lead from $x$ to $y$
* **composition** - combining two or more paths to get from the beginning of the first path to the end of the last path
* **inverse path** - the reverse order of a path to get from the last vertex back to the first vertex
