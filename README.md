# Notes

This is a way for me to standardize my notes across a wide range of topics.

In the past, I had a tendancy to work and re-work examples and proofs because I forgot what I did weeks ago. By writing notes in HTML, I hope to be able to keep track of what I have done in order to waste less time.
