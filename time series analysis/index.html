            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Time series analysis and forecasting allows a researcher to make inferences and predictions about processes as they evolve in time. It can be used in a variety of fields, from econometrics to signal processing. A time series can be thought of as a collection of sample datapoints of a process indexed by the time the sample is taken. I did not get the chance to learn time series in school, so I wanted to take the opportunity to study this field on my own. My notes for different sections will be provided throughout the pages on this blog. I hope that through the process of recording my study, I am able to preserve my knowledge and use these notes as a reference in the future. I also aim to introduce standard notation that will be consistent throughout the learning process. In-depth links to problem solutions will be given in PDFs.
