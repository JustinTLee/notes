# Set Theory

## Definitions

* **alphabet** - a set of symbols
* **block** - a member of a partition 
* **cardinality** - the number of distinct elements within a finite set, denoted by $|S|$
* **catenation** - the writing of two or more strings adjacently
* **complement** - the elements in one set but not in another set being compared to
* **countable set** - set corresponding to all distinct elements in a sequence
* **disjoint** - two or more sets that share no elements in common
* **equal** - two sets that have the same elements, denoted by $=$
* **finite** - a set with $n$ distinct elements
* **intersection** - a set that contains all of the common elements of two or more other sets
* **members** - elements that exist within a set
* **ordered pair** - a listing of objects $a$ and $b$ in a prescribed order $(a, b)$
* **partition** - a collection of non-empty, non-overlapping subsets of set $S$
* **permutation** - an arragement of members of a set into a sequence
* **power set** - set of all subsets of $S$, denoted by $P(S)$
* **regular expression** - a string constructed from the elements of a set and a subclass of symbols
* **sequence** - a list of elements ordered by increasing value
* **set** - well-defined collection of elements
* **strings** - finite sequences of members of a set, where the members are symbols
* **subset** - a set in which all members are also members of another set
* **symmetric difference** - the non-common elements between two or more sets
* **union** - a set that contains all of the elements of two or more other sets
